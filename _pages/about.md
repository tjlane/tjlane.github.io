I am a scientist interesting in building new technology to reveal the structure, dynamics, and function of life at the molecular scale.

I am currently leading the photobiology (PBIO) group at the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, DESY. Previously, I was a principal scientist at CHARM Therapeutics and a staff scientist at the the world's first hard X-ray free electron laser, the LCLS. During my PhD, I studied at Stanford under Vijay Pande and worked as part of the Folding@home team.


Research
======
My focus is on developing new technology to image life at the molecular scale, pushing the limits of we can do in space & time. 

At present, my team is focused on discovering new biology using frontier methods in crystallography, specifically:
1. time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) of photoactive proteins
2. extracting allosteric and dynamical information from large numbers of crystals subjected to perturbation, a field we coined "statistical crystallography"

If you are interested learning more about our group, including open positions, please visit the [the group site](http://pbio.cfel.de).


Consulting
======
In addition to expertise in frontier structural biology, I have industry experience developing corporate technical strategy, with a focus on the challenging but exciting intersection of machine learning and biology. [Reach out by email](mailto:photobio.consulting@gmail.com) to inquire.
