I am currently leading the photobiology (PBIO) group at the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, more commonly known as "DESY".Previously, I was a principal scientist at CHARM Therapeutics and a staff scientist at the the world's first hard X-ray free electron laser (Linac Coherent Light Source/LCLS). During my PhD, I studied at Stanford under Vijay Pande.


Research
======
My team is focused on discovering new biology using frontier methods in crystallography, specifically:
1. time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) of photoactive proteins
2. extracting allosteric and dynamical information from large numbers of crystals subjected to perturbation, a field we coined "statistical crystallography"

The group has a strong methods development culture. If you are interested learning more about our group, including open positions, please visit the [official DESY-PBIO website](http://pbio.cfel.de).


Consulting
======
In addition to deep expertise in cutting-edge structural biology relevant for drug discovery and biotech, I have industry experience developing technical strategy. My focus uniting people with computational and biological backgrounds so that they can multiply one another, rather than working at crossroads. Reach out if you are interested in consulting on technical strategy in the startup environment, XFEL-based structural biology, or high-throughput crystallography including ligand/fragment screens.
