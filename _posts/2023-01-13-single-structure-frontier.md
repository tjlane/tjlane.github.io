Dramatic advances in protein structure prediction have sparked debate as to whether the problem of predicting structure from sequence is solved or not. [In paper published in Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01760-4), I argue that AlphaFold2 and its peers are currently limited by the fact that they predict only a single structure, instead of a structural distribution, and that this realization is crucial for the next generation of structure prediction algorithms.
